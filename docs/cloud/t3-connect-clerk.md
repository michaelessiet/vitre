# T3 Connect Clerk Setup

T3 Connect uses Clerk authentication. The relay accepts Clerk JWTs only when they are generated from the `t3-relay` template with the shared `t3-code-relay` audience.

## Application Keys

T3 Connect is disabled in a fresh clone. To enable it for source builds, add a repository-root `.env`
or `.env.local` file:

```dotenv
T3CODE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<publishable key>
T3CODE_CLERK_JWT_TEMPLATE=<JWT template name>
T3CODE_CLERK_CLI_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=<public OAuth application client ID>
T3CODE_RELAY_URL=https://relay.example.com
```

The shared configuration loader accepts these canonical values. Existing aliases remain accepted as overrides for compatibility.

Configuration precedence is:

1. Process or CI environment variables.
2. Repository-root `.env.local`.
3. Repository-root `.env`.

The Clerk publishable key, JWT template name, CLI OAuth client ID, and relay URL are public
identifiers, not secrets.
The server build injects these values during its build step. A built artifact does not need an environment file at runtime. CI release builds should set `T3CODE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `T3CODE_CLERK_JWT_TEMPLATE`,
`T3CODE_CLERK_CLI_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, and `T3CODE_RELAY_URL` before building.

When CLI public values are absent, the `t3 connect` CLI command group is omitted. The bundled server still accepts runtime overrides for self-hosted or operator-managed deployments.

For a hosted relay deployment, copy `infra/relay/.env.example` to `infra/relay/.env`. The relay
deployment reads `RELAY_DOMAIN`, `RELAY_API_ZONE_NAME`, `RELAY_TUNNEL_ZONE_NAME`,
`CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, and `CLERK_JWT_AUDIENCE` through Effect `Config`. There are no checked-in
deployment defaults.
`vp run --filter t3code-relay deploy` invokes Alchemy from the relay directory, so Alchemy loads
`infra/relay/.env`. After a successful deployment, the wrapper updates the repository-root `.env`
with the deployed HTTPS relay URL. The relay still requires
`CLERK_SECRET_KEY` as an Alchemy secret. Never put `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` in a client application
environment or commit it to the repository.

The `prod` Alchemy stage owns the retained PlanetScale database. Non-production stages reference
that database and provision isolated PlanetScale branches, so deploy `prod` before creating a
personal developer stage.

## Headless CLI OAuth Application

The `t3 connect` commands authorize a headless environment with a separate Clerk OAuth application.
This uses an OAuth public client with PKCE, so the CLI stores no client secret.

In **Clerk Dashboard > OAuth applications**:

1. Create an OAuth application for the T3 CLI.
2. Enable the **Public** option so authorization-code exchange uses PKCE.
3. Add `http://127.0.0.1:34338/callback` as an allowed redirect URI.
4. Enable the `openid`, `profile`, and `email` scopes.
5. Set `T3CODE_CLERK_CLI_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` in the repository-root `.env` file and release build
   environment to the generated public client ID.

The CLI derives Clerk's frontend API URL from the publishable key and calls Clerk's
`/oauth/authorize` and `/oauth/token` endpoints directly. The relay is not involved in the OAuth
handshake; it only validates the issued Clerk bearer token when the CLI manages an environment link.

The CLI supports these headless operations:

```sh
t3 connect login
t3 connect link
t3 connect status
t3 connect unlink
t3 connect logout
t3 serve
```

`t3 connect login` opens the Clerk authorization flow and stores the CLI credential without enabling
cloud exposure. `t3 connect link` installs the pinned managed `cloudflared` binary when needed,
authorizes when needed, and records durable intent to expose the environment. It works without a
running T3 server. The next `t3 serve` or `t3 start` reconciles the relay link and launches the
managed tunnel. `t3 connect unlink` records disabled intent immediately, stops a reachable running
connector, and attempts to revoke the relay-side environment record. It retains the stored CLI
authorization so `t3 connect link` can re-enable exposure without another browser flow. `t3 connect
logout` performs the same cleanup and removes the stored CLI authorization.

The background service has an independent lifecycle. Connect setup may offer to install it, but
logout leaves it running; manage it with `t3 service status`, `install`, `update`, and `uninstall`.

The current OAuth callback listener binds to loopback port `34338`. When running the CLI over SSH,
forward that port before running `t3 connect login` or `t3 connect link`:

```sh
ssh -L 34338:127.0.0.1:34338 <host>
```

A relay-hosted callback broker can remove this port-forward requirement later without changing the
stored PKCE token model.

## JWT Template

In **Clerk Dashboard > JWT templates**, create a template with:

| Setting | Value                        |
| ------- | ---------------------------- |
| Name    | `t3-relay`                   |
| Claims  | `{ "aud": "t3-code-relay" }` |

Set `T3CODE_CLERK_JWT_TEMPLATE=t3-relay` in the repository-root `.env`, and set
`CLERK_JWT_AUDIENCE=t3-code-relay` in `infra/relay/.env`. Define `CLERK_JWT_TEMPLATE` and
`CLERK_JWT_AUDIENCE` in the production relay deployment environment as well. The stable `aud` value
is shared by production and non-production relay stages. The client-facing `T3CODE_RELAY_URL` still
selects the concrete relay deployment, but changing that URL does not require a JWT template change.

## Enable Waitlist Access

For a private beta where people should request access, use **Clerk Dashboard > Waitlist**:

1. Toggle on **Enable waitlist** and save.
2. Review requests on the same page and select **Invite** or **Deny**.

Approved users can authenticate through the CLI and connect to the relay.

## Alternative: Known-User Allowlist

For a closed beta where all permitted users are known in advance, use an allowlist instead of a
request-and-approval waitlist:

To restrict the beta to permitted email addresses or domains:

1. In **Clerk Dashboard > Restrictions > Allowlist**, add each permitted email address or email
   domain.
2. Enable the allowlist and save.
3. Alternatively, enable **Restricted mode** when all new users must be explicitly invited or
   manually created without a waitlist request flow.

Do not enable an empty allowlist: it blocks all new sign-ups.

Clerk allowlists control who can sign up. They do not revoke an existing user's active cloud
access. To remove an already-created user's access, ban that user in Clerk so their active
sessions are ended and future sign-ins are rejected.
