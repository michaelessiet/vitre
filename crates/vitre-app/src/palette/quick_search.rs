//! QuickSearch: the Electron `QuickSearch` overlay, in two modes.
//!
//! `Open` (⌘P) ranks open threads and workspace file paths; `Content` (⌘⇧F)
//! searches chat messages and file contents. Both are the same dialog with a
//! different corpus, which is how `apps/web/src/components/QuickSearch.tsx`
//! models it too.
//!
//! The overlay itself is gpui-component's [`Command`] hosted in a
//! [`Dialog`](gpui_component::dialog::Dialog): it already owns the query
//! field, the virtualized result list, arrow/Enter/Escape handling and the
//! empty slot. Only the corpus, the row bodies and the mode switch are ours.
