/**
 * GraphStore - sole owner of `<baseDir>/caches/graph/`.
 *
 * Nothing is ever written into the user's repository. Every graphify
 * invocation runs with `GRAPHIFY_OUT` pointed at a directory this service
 * computed, and no other module may compute a path inside the store.
 *
 * ```
 * <baseDir>/caches/graph/
 *   <projectId>/                     ProjectId — a UUIDv4, not a path hash
 *     <branchSlug>-<hash8>/
 *       meta.json                    T3-owned; graphify never touches it
 *       graphify-out/                GRAPHIFY_OUT points here
 * ```
 *
 * Entries are keyed by `(projectId, branch)` rather than by workspace path. A
 * single checkout keeps one path while its branch changes underneath it, so a
 * path key would serve a `main` graph after switching to a feature branch; a
 * worktree gets its own path per branch, so a path key would fragment. Git
 * forbids the same branch in two worktrees, which makes the pair unique across
 * both layouts.
 *
 * **`evict` is the most dangerous code in this feature** — a recursive delete
 * of a computed path, where the inputs (branch names, directory names read
 * back off disk) are not fully trusted. It therefore refuses unless the target
 * passes all four of: valid project-id segment, valid entry segment, real path
 * exactly equal to the expected path (which rules out symlinks), and a
 * strictly-inside-the-root containment check. A refusal is a
 * `GraphStorePathError` and is never swallowed.
