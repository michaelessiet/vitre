 * The graph feature wraps the external `graphify` tool, which turns a

 *
 * Payload sizing is the main constraint. A real graph is tens of thousands of
 * nodes, so the wire format never carries the whole thing:
 *
 * - `GraphSnapshot` is a community-level aggregate (counts, labels, hubs).
 * - `GraphSubgraph` is an explicitly bounded neighbourhood, fetched on demand.
